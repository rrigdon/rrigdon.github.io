# Identity Security Writing Samples

I created, implemented, and maintain the docs-as-code setup for SailPoint Technologies, which included training 13+ writers to use the custom stack to create and publish 11+ websites.

I additionally manage the documentation for multiple identity security and access governance products for SailPoint Technologies, including:

- [SailPoint AI Application Onboarding](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/ai/app_onboarding/index.html)

- [SailPoint Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/ciem/index.html)
