# Identity Security Writing Samples

I created and implemented the docs-as-code setup for SailPoint Technolgies, which included training 10+ writers in using the custom stack to publish 8+ websites. 

I additionally manage the documentation for multiple identity security and access governance products for SailPoint Technologies, including:

- [SailPoint Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/ciem/index.html)

- [Password Management](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/pwd/index.html)

- [Cloud Access Management](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/cam/help/)

- [Access Risk Management](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/access-risk-mgmt/help/)
