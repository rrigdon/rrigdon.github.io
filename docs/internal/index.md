# Internal Writing Samples

I've created over 150 pages of internal documentation for training and reference purposes.

At the Texas Secretary of State, as an editor and writer I created training materials for 1,300+ agency liasons throughout Texas. I additionally created internal documentation on editing and composing rules for the Texas Register.
