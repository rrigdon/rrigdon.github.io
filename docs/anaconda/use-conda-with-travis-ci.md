# Using conda with Travis CI

If you are already using Travis CI, using conda is a preferable
alternative to using apt-get and pip to install packages. The Debian
repos provided by Travis may not include packages for all versions of
Python or may not be updated as quickly. Installing such packages with
pip may also be undesirable, as this can take a long time, which can
consume a large portion of the 50 minutes that Travis allows for each
build. Using conda also lets you test the building of conda recipes on
Travis.

This page describes how to use conda to test a Python package on Travis
CI. However, you can use conda with any language, not just Python.

## The .travis.yml file

The following code sample shows how to modify the `.travis.yml` file to
use [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for a project that
supports Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6:

``` yaml
language: python
python:
  # We don't actually use the Travis Python, but this keeps it organized.
  - "2.7"
  - "3.5"
  - "3.6"
install:
  - sudo apt-get update
  # We do this conditionally because it saves us some downloading if the version is the same.
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION" == "2.7" ]]; then
      wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh;
    else
      wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh;
    fi
  - bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
  - source "$HOME/miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
  - hash -r
  - conda config --set always_yes yes --set changeps1 no
  - conda update -q conda
  # Useful for debugging any issues with conda
  - conda info -a

  # Replace dep1 dep2 ... with your dependencies
  - conda create -q -n test-environment python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION dep1 dep2 ...
  - conda activate test-environment
  - python setup.py install

script:
  # Your test script goes here
```

!!! note
    For information about the basic configuration for Travis CI, see [Building a Python Project](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/#Examples).


## Supporting packages that do not have official builds

To support a package that does not have official Anaconda build:

1.  [Build the package yourself](build-pkgs.md).
2.  Add it to an [Anaconda.org](http://Anaconda.org) channel.
3.  Add the following line to the install steps in `.travis.yml` so that
    it finds the packages on that channel:

    ``` yaml
     - conda config --add channels your_Anaconda_dot_org_username
    ```

!!! Note
    Replace `your_Anaconda_dot_org_username` with your user name.

## Building a conda recipe

If you support official conda packages for your project, you may want to
use conda-build in Travis, so the building of your recipe is tested as
well.

1.  Include the conda recipe in the same directory as your source code.
2.  In your `.travis.yml` file, replace the following line:

    ``` yaml
    - python setup.py install
    ```

    with these lines:

    ```  yaml
    - conda build your-conda-recipe
    - conda install your-package --use-local
    ```

AppVeyor
========

[AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) is a continuous build service for
Windows built on Azure and is an alternative to using Travis CI with
conda.

For an example project building conda packages on AppVeyor, see
<https://github.com/rmcgibbo/python-appveyor-conda-example>.

Bootstrap your environment
==========================

To bootstrap your environment, use the standalone conda approach in your
`appveyor.yml`:

```  yaml
# Config file for automatic testing at travis-ci.org

language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
  - "3.7"

install:
  - wget https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/conda-execs/conda-latest-linux-64.exe -O conda.exe
  - chmod +x conda.exe
  - export CONDA_ALWAYS_YES=1
  # This is where you put any extra dependencies you may have.
  - ./conda.exe create -p $HOME/miniconda python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION conda conda-build pytest six pytest-cov pytest-mock
  - export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
  - hash -r
  # Install your code here.
script:
  - pytest -v --color=yes --cov=cpr tests
after_success:
  - conda install codecov
  - codecov
```
