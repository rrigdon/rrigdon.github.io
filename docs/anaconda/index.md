# Anaconda Writing Samples

I was a tech writer at Anaconda, the open-source Python distributor, from 2018 - 2020. I maintained two help websites, conda and conda-build. This included working with the open-source community and internal stakeholders to add and improve content, as well as learning basic Python and yaml code.

The help docs were generated using ReStructured Text, VS Code, Sphinx, and a CI/CD pipeline.

A few examples from my time at Anaconda include:

- [Conda-build recipes](recipe.md) 
- [Building skeleton packages](build-pkgs-skeleton.md)
- [Building conda packages](building-conda-packages.md)
- [Building conda packages from scratch](building-conda-packages.md)
- [Using conda with Travis CI](using-conda-with-travis-ci.md)
