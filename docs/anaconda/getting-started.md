# Getting started

Before starting the tutorials, consider reviewing
`how to install and update conda build <../../install-conda-build>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`conda build concepts <../../concepts/index>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

You may also find our
`resources <../../resources/index>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
collection helpful.

## Prerequisites {#prereqs}

Before starting the tutorials, you will need to install [Miniconda or
Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), conda build, and
git.

After you\'ve installed Miniconda or Anaconda, you can use conda to
install conda build and git.

## Tutorial submissions {#submissions}

Have an idea for a tutorial? You can submit your suggestions to Anaconda
by emailing us at
[documentation@anaconda.com](documentation@anaconda.com).

To create your own tutorials, follow the
`writing style guide <../resources/style-guide>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
