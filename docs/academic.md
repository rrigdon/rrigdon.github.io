# Academic Writing Samples

I earned my M.A. in Rhetoric and Public Culture from Northwestern University in 2012.

I wrote and edited over 250 pages of content in that time, including [The Invisible American Family](http://www.nocaptionneeded.com/2011/06/the-invisible-american-family/) post featured on Professor Robert Hariman's blog on photography and social justice.
