# Writing Portfolio

My first job was at 13 writing about rodeos and stick horse races, and I haven't stopped writing since. From journalism to academia to software documentation, I'm skilled in addressing multiple audiences, in multiple ways, using multiple technical skills and tools. 

I've worked as both a solo tech writer and a team lead producing software documentation for government agencies, start-ups, and large-scale enterprises. I excel at creating and training technical processes, including managing a docs-as-code system used by 10+ writers to support 11+ help sites. 

I'm skilled in docs-as-code, technical writing, editing, GitHub, project management, consulting, content writing, training, Confluence, Jira, agile, mentoring, and learning new things.
