# Writing Portfolio

My first job was at 13 writing about rodeos and stick horse races, and I haven't stopped writing since. From journalism to academia to software documentation, I'm skilled in addressing multiple audiences, in multiple ways, using multiple technical skills and tools. 

I've worked as both a solo tech writer and a team lead producing software documentation for government agencies, start-ups, and large-scale enterprises. I excel at creating and training technical processes, including managing a docs-as-code system used by 10+ writers to support 8+ help sites.

You can view samples of my technical writing from [Anaconda](anaconda/index.md), the Python package distributor, as well as actively maintained [public documentation](id_security.md) from SailPoint Technologies. I've also included samples of my [academic work](academic.md).
