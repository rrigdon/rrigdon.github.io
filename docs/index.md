# Writing Portfolio

My first job was at 13 writing about rodeos and stick horse races, and I haven't stopped writing since. From journalism to academia to software documentation, I'm skilled in addressing multiple audiences, in multiple ways, using multiple technical skills and tools.

I am currently the Lead Technical Writer for SaaS documentation at SailPoint Technologies in Austin, TX. I'm a vocal advocate for centering users' needs in product and doc decisions. I love a technical challenge and specialize in setting up docs-as-code systems and information architectures. I'm also passionate about mentoring, both at work and with volunteer organizations.

In addition to my writing experience, I excel at project development and cross-functional collaboration. I've launched multiple projects increasing the reach and engagement of product documentation with customers.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, cooking, mentoring youth, and learning new technologies.
