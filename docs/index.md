# Writing Portfolio

My first job was at 13 writing about rodeos and stick horse races, and I haven't stopped writing since. From journalism to academia to software documentation, I'm skilled in addressing multiple audiences, in multiple ways, using multiple technical skills and tools.

## Writing Samples
You can view samples of my writing from:

- Actively maintained [Identity Security public documentation](id_security.md) from SailPoint Technologies
- [Anaconda](anaconda/index.md), the Python package distributor
- [CS Disco](disco.md), a legaltech startup
- [Southwestern University](academic.md#as-a-professor) as a professor
- [Northwestern University Graduate School](academic.md#as-a-student) as a student
